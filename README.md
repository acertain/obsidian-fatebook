does two things:

1. ctrl+shift+f to create prediction & insert link at cursor
2. updates name of links to fatebook.io to always match fatebook (if you change the prediction name in fatebook or update your prediction or resolve it)

used to also do hover on links, but that disabled & a little broken

there's also https://github.com/GarretteBaker/obsidian-fatebook , which has a different UI & set of features
